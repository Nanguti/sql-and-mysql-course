# Introduction to SQL and MySQL

## What is SQL?

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standardized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations such as retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting data from a database.

### **Purpose of SQL**

- Querying and fetching data from databases.
- Defining the structure of database schemas.
- Ensuring data integrity and relationships.
- Managing permissions and security on databases.

## Difference between SQL and MySQL

| Feature        | SQL                                                              | MySQL                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | A language for querying and managing data.                       | A relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL. |
| **Purpose**    | Provides the syntax and commands for interacting with databases. | Stores and organizes data; executes SQL commands.              |
| **Type**       | Standardized language, not software.                             | Software application for database management.                  |
| **Ownership**  | Not owned; an ISO/ANSI standard.                                 | Owned by Oracle Corporation.                                   |

## Use Cases for MySQL in Web and App Development

- **Web Applications**: Backing systems like e-commerce platforms, blogs, or forums.
- **Data Warehousing**: Organizing and managing large datasets.
- **Mobile Applications**: Managing user data, app settings, and content dynamically.
- **IoT Solutions**: Handling data from IoT devices.
- **Custom APIs**: Powering RESTful and GraphQL APIs.

## Installing MySQL on Different Platforms

### **Windows**

1. Download the MySQL Installer from [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
3. Configure MySQL Server:
   - Root password.
   - Port (default: 3306).
4. Verify installation using `mysql -u root -p` in the command line.

### **macOS**

1. Install Homebrew (if not installed):

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Use Homebrew to install MySQL:

   ```bash
   brew install mysql
   ```

3. Start the MySQL service:

   ```bash
   brew services start mysql
   ```

4. Secure the installation:

   ```bash
   mysql_secure_installation
   ```

### **Linux**

1. Update your package list:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Install MySQL:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```

3. Secure the installation:

   ```bash
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```

4. Test installation:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

## Introduction to MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, and CLI

### **MySQL Workbench**

A graphical user interface for MySQL that allows users to design, manage, and administer databases visually.

- Useful for database design and modeling.
- Provides SQL editors for writing queries.
- Includes tools for performance monitoring.

### **phpMyAdmin**

A web-based application for managing MySQL databases.

- Popular in LAMP/LEMP stack setups.
- User-friendly interface for managing tables, executing queries, and exporting data.

### **Command Line Interface (CLI)**

- Directly interact with MySQL Server via terminal commands.
- Examples:

  - Log in to MySQL:

    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

  - Create a database:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE example_db;
    ```

  - Show databases:

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```
